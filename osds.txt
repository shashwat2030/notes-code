disk scheduliding algorithm goal to minmize the seek time
hardware structure of hard disk now mainly the hardisk consist 
of multiple platters having different tracks which contains 
different sectors
making the hirearchy 
platter cd shape disk now basically consist of two surface 
categorisewhich are  upper side and lower side 
|
track now these you can say tissue in the body track are the basic 
unit of  upper as well as lower side containing the basic sector 
storage  which can be the blocks of sector big container which
contains group of  sectors
|
sector -data store in these sectors basic basic unit of track or the 
basic unit of hardisk where data is ultimately reside

to achieve the request of data 
scan  algorithm 
elevator algorithm
moving in one direction towards the larger value  just larger 
zvalue of the head continue in the following the algorithm 
handling all the request in increasing direction of the request 
and the fact is that we have move to the highest point moving 
in the next word.
